            I’m a systems-oriented software engineer with interests in correctness, tooling, and low-level system design.
            At Cornell’s Capra CS Lab, I built Python automation to orchestrate benchmark execution and modeled
            constraints in Z3 to verify correctness properties of experimental systems.
        </p>

        <p class="interests">
            I also implemented and revisited a FAT-style filesystem in C to strengthen my understanding of
            memory safety, file system invariants, and systems-level debugging using tools such as Valgrind and gdb.
