Hello! I'm Meredith, a developer interested in programming languages, compilers, and systems.
I'm a recent May 2024 graduate of Cornell University. At Cornell, I double majored in Computer Science and Classics,
was a part of the Milstein Program for Technology and the Humanities, and did programming languages research for CU Capra.
Outside of programming, I like cleaning and watching lawncare videos on YouTube.
