I finally launched this website! I had been planning to make one for a long time, but I was playing around with a lot of different hosting services.
A friend told me about github pages being a free and easy-to-use website hosting service, and so far I've been very pleased with the results.
I'm making the process smoother by using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for my website, which is a nice website service that 
makes it easy to standardize layouts across website pages.
I'm planning to use this website to aggregate all of my online presences, projects, and updates into one place. 
I have a few different blogs scattered around the web, as well as projects and things I'm constantly learning.
Hopefully by putting them into one place, someone looking for information on me can get an accurate picture of what I do at once.
I'm excited for this new adventure - I hope you keep reading!
